The sooner we overcome the initial communication obstacles, the more you will access the benefits of the therapy. We will also discuss about consent, privacy and data protection. Further, I will ask you a set of questions, in order to establish the approach that is suited for you. 
In the second part of the meeting we'll focus on your current concerns or burdens.</p>
