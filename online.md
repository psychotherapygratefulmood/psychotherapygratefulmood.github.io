# Online psychotherapy

Online psychotherapy is the provision of mental health services through the virtual environment, using the Internet. It can be used either as an addition to classical psyhcotherapy, or as a replacement for it.
This form of counseling was used since the 90s, but it started growing considerably in the last 10 years. 

The extension of research in the field of online counseling, delivered promising results: technology could contribute to an evolution of how people receive mental health services, improving the adressability and access to help.

## In what form can online psychotherapy be delivered?

* video conferencing 
* online chat
* messaging
* e-mails
* internet phone calls

## What are the benefits?

A growing number of studies in this field (see references) established the efficacy of online counseling at least equal to traditional in-office approach. Here are some potential reasons:

1. **Access**

An extended category of people can be part of the online environment, such as: rural area population, disabled people, minors, expats. Generally, the internet extends the access to psychotherapy to those who do not find themselves in the proximity of a counseling office.

2. **Cost**

Online therapy is generally cheaper than face-to-face services and so, an extended number of people can profit from its benefits.

3. **Appointments**

The time schedules for online services tend to be more flexible, and even extended to night-hours or emergency hot-lines, to situations that can benefit an extended group of people.

4. **Privacy**

In the online environment, patients can choose to stay private, an advantage that is simply unfeasible in traditional in-office setting.

5. **Anxiety & distress**

The online approach can offer more comfort to the patient and a decreased level of distress of anticipation anxiety, that are very common in the traditional form of therapy. Behind the screen, the patients simply open up faster, which leads to earlier acheivment of collaboration and communication. This can be in the benefit of people who have comunication difficulties, who triyed face-to-face therapy but failed to create openness, or simply to those who have a stronger component of shyness in the traits of their personality.

## Are there any down-sides to consider?

Everythig has advantages and disadvantages, so here are some of the down-sides of online counseling:

1. **Technology**

Unreliable means of communication or connexion can create interruptions in the flow of the session, leading to delayed responses or even comunication loss or changes in the schedule.

2. **Confidentiality**

The thechnology nowadays can be attacked or hacked, which could expose the patient to loss of confidentiality. Make sure to choose the means of communications that are suited to your personal desires in terms of confidentiality and data security. Check my article about **Choosing a communication platform**

3. **Reliability**

In the online environment is harder to control and check the psychotherapist's qualifications and reliability. Make sure to ask for proof of qualification (diplomas/certificates) and to check their validity, according to the laws.

4. **Body language**

Body language can be a great diagnostic/information tool for psychotherapists and counslers. It can provide the therapist with important additional information related to the patient's feelings, thoughts or behaviors. Online environment considerably reduces the posibility of observing these elements.

## Effectiveness

The main goal of online counseling is to alleviate distress and improve the patient's functionality and approach to chalenging life situations. According to different patient-surveys (see references), it was shown that the level of satisfaction and goal achievment was equal in online counseling, compared to traditional psychotherapy, especially for the people functioning at a moderate to high level. Ongoing research will determine weather, in the future, online help could provide benefits for suicidal ideation or psychotic episodes.
