# Cognitive behavioral therapy

## What is it?

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of talking therapy that looks at the links between the thoughts, feelings and behaviors, aiming to improve mental health. 
The past experiences influence the way one thinks and thoughts affect the feelings, which lead to specific behaviors. There is an ongoing interdependent relationship between these three elements, which can lead to vicious circles, or "bad programming", that further causes psychological problems. CBT helps breaking this vicious circle, by learning how to change one's relationship to maladaptive thinking and behave differentely, which will further have impact on the feelings. CBT helps develop personal non-destructive coping mechanisms, that target solving current problems.

CBT is a modern form of psychotherapy, that is "problem-solving" and "action-oriented", meaning that it solves specific problems, according to the patient's needs.
