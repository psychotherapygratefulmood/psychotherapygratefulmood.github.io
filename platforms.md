# Choosing a comunication platform

When it comes to online communication, choosing the platform that is the most suited for you, can be a tricky thing to do. Here are some elements to take into consideration when choosing a communication provider:

* Performance - different apps have different levels of technical performance, especially when it comes to video conferencing. Make sure to test the applications before, in order to get an idea about the differences in connection delay and clarity of sound or image.

* Data protection - apps have different levels of data protection, raging from no protection at all, to end-to-end encryption, from proprietory to free and open source software.

* Cost - paid or unpaid;

* Features - some apps are all-in-one, providing video calls, voice calls and instant chat;

* Devices - some applications only work on computers, some only on mobile devices.
